Flight 06 file is a Power BI file and it is built for user to understand the price, layover of flights moving from one location to another in the country of USA.
It has Gauge, Slicer, Table, Flow Map, Card as a Visualization tool. I have made this dashboard keeping in mind the users of USA Airways. 

Another project is about Passbook Management System. It is a software application which is developed using Python programming language. 
Python is a versatile and widely used programming language that is suitable for developing complex web applications and systems. 
I have used different modules like mysql.connector and execute method of cursor class. I have handled exceptions too in this project so that 
if user input wrong data then the program should not end abruptly. Passbook Management System keeps the record of every entry and also keeps 
user data like created account ,checks balance , deposited amount and the withdrawal amount.
